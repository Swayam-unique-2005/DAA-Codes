Aim
To implement the Bubble Sort algorithm in C to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

Algorithm
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Take an array of n elements as input.
Step 3: Repeat for i = 0 to n-2:

a. Compare adjacent elements in the array.
b. If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.
Step 4: Continue until no more swaps are needed.
Step 5: Display the sorted array.
Step 6: Stop
