Aim
To implement the Insertion Sort algorithm in C to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

Algorithm
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Take an array of n elements as input.
Step 3: Repeat for each element in the array starting from the second element:

a. Compare the current element with its predecessors.
b. Shift all elements that are greater than the current element to one position ahead.
c. Insert the current element into its correct position.
Step 4: Repeat until all elements are sorted.
Step 5: Display the sorted array.
Step 6: Stop
