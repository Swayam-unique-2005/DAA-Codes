Aim
To implement the Binary Search algorithm in C to find the position of an element in a sorted array.

Algorithm
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Take a sorted array of n elements and the element to search (key).
Step 3: Set low = 0 and high = n-1.
Step 4: Repeat while low â‰¤ high:

a. Calculate mid = (low + high) / 2.
b. If arr[mid] == key, return mid.
c. If key < arr[mid], set high = mid - 1.
d. If key > arr[mid], set low = mid + 1.
Step 5: If the element is not found, return -1.
Step 6: Stop
