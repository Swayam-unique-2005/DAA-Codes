Aim
To implement the Linear Search algorithm in C to find the position of an element in an array.

Algorithm
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Take an array of n elements and the element to search (key).
Step 3: Compare key with each element of the array one by one:

a. If a match is found, return the index.
b. If no match is found, return -1.
Step 4: Stop
